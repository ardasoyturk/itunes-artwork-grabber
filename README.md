# iTunes Artwork Grabber

This is a simple artwork grabber which uses iTunes' servers to get the required info.

## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank Ben Dodson for his great work at his own [iTunes Artwork Finder](https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder). I used that project so many times and this project wouldn't be possible without him.

## About the project stack

I used Theo's [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) to build this app. It uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
